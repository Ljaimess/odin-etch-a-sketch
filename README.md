Etch-A-Sketch application made with javascript

In this application it utilizes DOM manipulation.
I Dynamicly render the grid using two for loops set on load to 16.
The user can then choose what size the grid is by using the inputs for the x and y axis.
There is also a clear grid button to start a new drawing.
To make it fun the grid is set to a random color when the user hovers the mouse over a box.
